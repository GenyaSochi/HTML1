        Linear Equations
      </b>
    </p>
    <p>
      A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form
    </p>
    <p class="formula">
      ax + b = 0
    </p>
    <p>
      where a and b are real numbers and x is a variable. This form is sometimes called the standard form of a linear
      equation. Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form. Also, the variable may or may not be an
      x so donâ€™t get too locked into always seeing an x there.
    </p>

      <b>
        Quadratic Equation
      </b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:
    </p>
    <p class="formula">
      ax^2 + bx + c = 0
    </p>
    <p>
      where a, b, c are known values and x is the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet). Also, a can't be 0.

      The area of a circle (A)

    </p>
    <p> 
      [sign] (Pi) times the radius (r) squared:
    </p>
    <p class="formula">
      A = [sign] [sign] r^2
    </p>
    <p>
     or, when you know the diameter (D):
    </p>
    <p class="formula">
      A = [sign] / (4) [sign] D^2
    </p>
    <p>
      or, when you know the circumference (C):
    </p>
    <p class="formula">
      A = C^2 / 4 [sign] [sign]
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>
      Intersection
      </b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The intersection of two sets A and B, denoted by A [sign] B, is the set of all objects that are members of both the
    sets A and B. In symbols,
    </p>  
    <p class="formula">
      A [sign] B = { x : x [sign] A and x [sign] B }
    </p>
    <p>
      That is, x is an element of the intersection A [sign] B if and only if x is both an element of A and an element of
      B.
