  <h1>Vehicle</h1>
<div>
  <p>A vehicle (from Latin: vehiculum <sup><a href="#1">[1]</a></sup>) is a machine that transports people or cargo. Vehicles include wagons,<br>
  bicycles, motor vehicles (motorcycles, cars, trucks, buses), railed vehicles (trains, trams), watercraft (ships, <br>
  boats), amphibious vehicles (screw-propelled vehicle, hovercraft), aircraft (airplanes, helicopters) and spacecraft. <sup>[2]</sup>
  
  </p>

  <p>
    Land vehicles are classified broadly by what is used to apply steering and drive forces against the ground: <br>  
    wheeled, tracked, railed or skied. ISO 3833-1977 is the standard, also internationally used in legislation, for <br> road vehicles types, terms and definitions. <sup>[3]</sup></p>
