<h2>What is HTML?</h2>
<p><b>Hypertext Markup Language <abbr title="HTML">HTML</abbr></b> is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web <br> applications.</p>
<br>

<p>Web browsers receive  HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents <br> into multimedia web pages. 
   HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally <br> included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>

<p> HTML elements are the building blocks of  HTML pages. With  HTML constructs, images and other
   objects <br> such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.  HTML provides a means to create <br> structured documents
   by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, <br> quotes and other items.  HTML elements are
   delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <br> &lt;img/&gt; and &lt;input/&gt; directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as &lt;p&gt;
   surround and <br> provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not <br> display the HTML tags, but use
   them to interpret the content of the page.HTMLelements are the building blocks <br> of  HTML pages.

<h2>Markup</h2>

<p> HTML markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes),<br>character-based data types, character references and entity
   references.  HTML tags most commonly come in <br> pairs like &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;/h1&gt;, although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example <br> &lt;img&gt;. The first
   tag in such a pair is the start tag, <br> and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening <br> tags and closing tags).</p>

<p>Another important component is the  HTML document type declaration, which triggers standards mode <br> rendering.</p>

<p>The following is an example of the classic "Hello, World!" program:</p>

<p><!DOCTYPE html></p>

<html>

<head>

<title>This is a title</title>

</head>

<body>

<p>Hello world!</p>

</body>

</html>
